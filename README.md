# User-account-canary-tokens
Organizations are constantly looking for new and creative ways to identify and prevent potential threats to their data and systems in the ever-changing field of cybersecurity. The innovative method called "User Account Canary Tokens" is proposed in this project to improve security measures by successfully detecting unauthorized access and activity within an information system. Decoy user accounts called User Account Canary Tokens are used to lure in possible attackers. These accounts are purposefully made with vulnerabilities and tempting privileges to entice bad actors. When these accounts are compromised or subjected to unauthorized access attempts, alerts are set off, offering important information about the goals and strategies of the hacker. The goal of this project is to design, develop, and implement a system that logs and analyzes interactions between Canary Tokens in addition to generating and embedding them. In order to provide useful data for analysis, the system will generate comprehensive log files that document each interaction with the Canary Tokens, including access attempts, time stamps and user information. Detection and Alerting. When unauthorized activities are discovered or Canary Tokens are accessed, the project will put in place an effective detection mechanism to notify stakeholders. Administrators and users will receive alerts, guaranteeing prompt responses to possible security breaches. Data Analysis. By analyzing the log files to find trends, abnormalities, and patterns in user account access, the project will also concentrate on data analysis. This examination will help to clarify the nature and scope of potential threats and attacks. In addition, the project will assess how well Canary Tokens work to prevent unwanted access and account compromise, which will enhance user account security in digital systems as a whole. Organizations seeking to improve their security measures will find great value in the results and findings. The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive approach to user account security by combining technical development with user education. This will ultimately lower the risk of data breaches and improve the protection of sensitive user information.
